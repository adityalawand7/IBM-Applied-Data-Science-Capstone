<h1>SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction</h1>

<h2>Project Overview:</h2>
<p>This repository contains the code and documentation for my capstone project in the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate specialization on Coursera. The project focuses on building a machine learning model that predicts whether the first stage of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully.</p>

<h2>Project Objective:</h2>
<p>The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model capable of determining whether the first stage of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will successfully land after launch.</p>

<h2>Project Steps:</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Business Understanding:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Defined the business problem: To create a model that can predict the successful landing of the first stage of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Data Understanding:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Explored the dataset containing information about 1,358 Falcon 9 launches.</li>
            <li>Identified and understood the different features available in the dataset, including launch date, location, weather conditions, and landing success status.</li>
            <li>Checked for missing values and outliers in the data.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Data Preparation:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Performed data cleaning to handle missing values and outliers effectively.</li>
            <li>Imputed missing values using suitable techniques.</li>
            <li>Encoded categorical features to make the data suitable for modeling.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
    <li><strong>Modeling:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Built several machine learning models to predict the first stage landing success, including:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Logistic Regression</li>
                <li>Decision Tree Classifier</li>
                <li>Support Vector Machine</li>
                <li>K-Nearest Neighbors</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Evaluation:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Evaluated the performance of the models using accuracy as the primary evaluation metric.</li>
            <li>Selected the best-performing model based on evaluation results.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>Project Results:</h2>
<p>The best model achieved an accuracy of 83.33% in predicting whether the first stage of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket would land successfully. This means the model could correctly predict the outcome 83.33% of the time.</p>

<h2>Challenges and Solutions:</h2>
<p>One challenge encountered during the project was handling missing values in the dataset. To address this, I decided to remove the rows with missing values, ensuring that the data used for modeling was clean and complete.</p>
