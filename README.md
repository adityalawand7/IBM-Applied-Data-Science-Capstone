# IBM-Applied-Data-Science-Capstone
Project Overview:
This repository contains the code and documentation for my capstone project in the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate specialization on Coursera. The project focuses on building a machine learning model that predicts whether the first stage of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully.

Project Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model capable of determining whether the first stage of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will successfully land after launch.

Project Steps:
To complete the project, I followed the CRISP-DM methodology, and the major steps involved were as follows:

Business Understanding:

Defined the business problem: To create a model that can predict the successful landing of the first stage of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.
Data Understanding:

Explored the dataset containing information about 1,358 Falcon 9 launches.
Identified and understood the different features available in the dataset, including launch date, location, weather conditions, and landing success status.
Checked for missing values and outliers in the data.
Data Preparation:

Performed data cleaning to handle missing values and outliers effectively.
Imputed missing values using suitable techniques.
Encoded categorical features to make the data suitable for modeling.
Modeling:

Built several machine learning models to predict the first stage landing success, including:
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree Classifier
Support Vector Machine
K-Nearest Neighbors
Evaluation:

Evaluated the performance of the models using accuracy as the primary evaluation metric.
Selected the best-performing model based on evaluation results.
Project Results:
The best model achieved an accuracy of 83.33% in predicting whether the first stage of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket would land successfully. This means the model could correctly predict the outcome 83.33% of the time.

Challenges and Solutions:
One challenge encountered during the project was handling missing values in the dataset. To address this, I decided to remove the rows with missing values, ensuring that the data used for modeling was clean and complete.

Project Report:
The detailed project report, including the methodology, data analysis, model building, and evaluation results, can be found in the project report within this repository.
